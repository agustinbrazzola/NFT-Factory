NFT - Buyer-Mints

Hey there! 

This is a prototype of a NFT minting website, done with scaffold-eth. 

It's using Open Zeppelin's libraries with safemath operations to avoid overflow. 

It's also ready to run a subgraph. It's developed and tested with hardhat. 

Thank you for stopping by. If you have any comments let me know.
